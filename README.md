# Vagrant Development Environment Projects 
This repository contains Vagrant projects for the creation of VMs for Development Environment.
It is expected that this project is checked out on a Windows Host in c:\Data\git\makker\vagrant. 
Of course you can do a check out in a folder of your own liking. You may want to fork this project for this purpose.  You will need to update the particular _Vagrantfile_ or _setting.yml_ files of the vagrant projects within this repository, to adapt for the sharedFolder mappings.
